# Summary of Slides

**Top 5 Key Themes Across the CS 4260 Slide Sets**

| # | Theme | Core Ideas & Why They Matter |
|---|-------|------------------------------|
| **1** | **Search & Planning Algorithms** | Uninformed search (BFS, DFS, UCS) + Informed search (A*, heuristic design).  Includes constraint‑satisfaction, graph traversal, and optimization over state‑spaces.  These form the algorithmic backbone for solving combinatorial problems, robotics path‑planning, and AI planning. |
| **2** | **Supervised & Unsupervised Learning Foundations** | Supervised learning (classification, regression, loss functions, gradient‑based optimization) + Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, generative models).  Covers key concepts such as bias‑variance trade‑off, regularization, and the statistical learning framework that underpins modern AI. |
| **3** | **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** | Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), policy/value functions, temporal‑difference learning, and policy gradients.  Emphasizes exploration‑exploitation, reward shaping, and the learning‑from‑feedback loop that powers agents in dynamic environments. |
| **4** | **Language Models & NLP** | Sequence modeling (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers), attention mechanisms, pre‑training & fine‑tuning, and evaluation metrics (perplexity, BLEU).  Highlights how statistical language models capture syntax, semantics, and context for tasks like translation, summarization, and dialogue. |
| **5** | **Probabilistic & Decision‑Theoretic Foundations** | Bayesian inference, graphical models (Bayes nets, MRFs), decision theory (utility, risk), and probabilistic reasoning under uncertainty.  Provides the mathematical language that ties together search, learning, and RL into a coherent theory of intelligent decision‑making. |

These themes distill the most critical concepts presented across the Searching and Machine‑Learning slide sets from Prof. Doug Fisher, Pieter Abbeel, Igor Mordatch, and Kyle Moore. They give a coherent framework for understanding the algorithmic, statistical, and theoretical building blocks of modern artificial intelligence.
