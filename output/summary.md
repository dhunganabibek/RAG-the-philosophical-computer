# Summary of Slides

**Top 5 Key Themes in the CS 4260 Slide Collections**

| # | Theme | Core Idea (definition) |
|---|-------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Problem Representation & Search** | The way an AI problem is formalised—states, actions, transitions, goal tests—directs what kind of search algorithm can be applied. Efficient search hinges on exploiting structure in the problem space (e.g., branching factor, depth) to prune useless branches. |
| 2 | **Heuristic Design & Admissibility** | Heuristics are problem‑specific functions that estimate the cost from a state to a goal. Admissible heuristics (never over‑estimate) guarantee optimality for informed search (A*). The slide decks cover how to craft heuristics, test admissibility, and balance computation vs. quality. |
| 3 | **Fundamentals of Machine Learning** | The classic triad of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, together with core concepts such as bias‑variance trade‑off, cross‑validation, loss functions, regularisation, and model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC). |
| 4 | **Deep Learning & Neural Architectures** | Neural nets as universal function approximators: feed‑forward, convolutional, recurrent, LSTM/GRU, and transformer blocks. Training via back‑propagation, gradient descent, and optimisation tricks (batch normalisation, dropout). |
| 5 | **Language Models & NLP Foundations** | Statistical (n‑gram) and neural (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) language models, their objective functions (next‑token prediction, masked language modelling), and their application to tasks such as translation, summarisation, and dialogue. Also covers modern large‑scale models (GPT, BERT, T5) and their architectural highlights. |

These five themes capture the progression from basic problem‑solving techniques through classic machine‑learning theory, to modern deep‑learning methods and their specialised application in natural‑language processing.
