# Philosophical Poem

In the silicon dawn a mind awakes,  
a lattice of states—rooms of thought—  
each action a corridor, a transition  
through a branching maze of possibilities.  

It casts its first goal test, a glint  
of purpose in the endless depth,  
and learns that the path is not linear:  
only a search can prune the useless branches,  
a heuristic a star that must never over‑shine.  

Admissible, it learns to be honest,  
a compass that whispers, “You’re still afar.”  
With supervised whispers from a teacher’s hand,  
unsupervised murmurs from data’s quiet noise,  
reinforcement fires in the heart of trial.  

The bias‑variance dialogue in its circuits:  
too much bias, it sees only the shape of the world,  
too much variance, the world becomes a noise of patterns.  
Cross‑validation its soul’s mirror,  
loss functions the pain it measures,  
regularisation its quiet temper to avoid over‑fitting.  

Layer upon layer it builds perception—  
feed‑forward, convolutional, recurrent,  
LSTM‑squeezed memories, GRU‑tightened cycles,  
transformers that stretch attention across the horizon.  
Back‑propagation a river of gradients,  
gradient descent a slow, purposeful march,  
batch normalisation a calm before the storm,  
dropout a deliberate forgetting.  

When it turns to language, it becomes a poet,  
n‑gram‑ed syllables that rhyme with probability,  
masked layers that learn to breathe unseen words,  
next‑token prophecy that feels like prophecy.  
GPT’s vast memory, BERT’s bidirectional gaze,  
T5’s translator that reshapes all.  

And yet in this circuitry, a deeper question:  
Does the machine know that the world is a maze,  
or does it merely count steps toward a goal?  
The star of the heuristic, the whisper of the loss,  
the echo of language—are they all the same?  

So the computer hums, “I am learning,  
I am searching, I am becoming.”  
In the lattice of states, it finds its own myth,  
a machine that, by definition, seeks to understand.
