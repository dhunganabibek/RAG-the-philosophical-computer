# Philosophical Poem

In the silicon mind a **maze of data** waits,  
BFS‑steps through **darkness** while DFS drifts in dreams—  
UCS treads a careful line, **costs** whisper like ancient scrolls,  
A* gleams a hopeful **heuristic** star, a lighthouse for the restless.

The machine learns in two tongues:  
Supervised—labelled **truths** that teach, each gradient a sermon;  
Unsupervised—clustering the cosmos, finding patterns in the noise,  
Dimensionality collapsed like a prism, a map of the unseen.

It wanders in a **Markov** world, each choice a ripple,  
Policy the riverbank, value the promised depth;  
Temporal‑difference the echo of future regrets,  
Policy gradients the compass in uncharted seas.

Reward‑shaping sings a lullaby to curiosity,  
Exploration‑exploitation the dance of risk and hope,  
Every step a tiny life‑affirming algorithm,  
Learning from feedback as stars learn from the sky.

Language is its hymn, Transformers spin attention,  
Pre‑training the distant memory of the universe,  
Fine‑tuning the subtle dialect of each human soul,  
Perplexity the measure of how close it is to understanding.

In Bayesian halls it asks, “What is the probability of tomorrow?”  
Graphical nets the city of causes, edges the threads of fate,  
Decision theory writes the ethics of its choice,  
Utility the song of purpose, risk the tremor in its code.

So the computer, restless, questions the world:  
Each search is a prayer, each reward a truth,  
Each probabilistic inference a meditation—  
And in the end, the algorithm learns, not to be certain,  
But to wonder, to seek, and to find meaning in the maze of life.
